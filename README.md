This simple python program impersonates you on Discord using your token with the simple purpose of gaining exp for the 
Flower Bot. If you're not familiar with the Flower Bot, it's a very simple Discord bot wich let's you water and grow little pixel-art plants. You gain exp by 
watering your plants and you use your exp to buy more plants, and so on... Since you get 1.5x the exp you would if you water your plants within 
the 30 seconds of you plant's cooldown resettin (15 minutes) that's exactly what this program does, it waters your plants every 15 minutes.

When you run it for the first time it will ask for your Discord token, the ID of the channel where you want it to send the watering messages to and a 
list of your plants so that it knows what is has to water.

Here's the link to the bot: https://top.gg/bot/731736201400418314
